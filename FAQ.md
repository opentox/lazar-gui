Frequently Asked Questions
==========================
<br>
####How does this prediction works?
>

####You talk about significant fragments. Where can I find them?
> We will show up those significant fragments in a further version.

####What is endpoint details about?
> You get the source from where we took compounds for the endpoint. The type and the number of compounds we used.

####What is three times independent validation about?
>

####Do you consider providing plots for the validation results?
> In a further version we will show up confidence and correlation plots.

####What does 'Not enough similar compounds in training dataset' mean?
> Lazar uses neighbors from the training dataset of the endpoint to predict your compound. If there are not enough neighbors for Lazar it is not possible to make a prediction.

####Is there a minimum number of necessary neighbors to make a prediction?
>  

####How can I activate the 'batch prediction' option?
> Please contact us directly via [mail](mailto:support@in-silico.ch).

####Not the right answers for me. Is there a way to contact you or report problems.
> You can always ask your questions via [mail](mailto:support@in-silico.ch). If you run into problems with the GUI please post your issue [here](https://github.com/opentox/lazar-gui/issues).
